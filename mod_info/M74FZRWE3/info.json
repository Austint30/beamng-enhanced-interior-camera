    "message": "This is my first ever BeamNG mod! I have noticed that there aren't many camera script mods available, so I decided to make one to the best of my ability.\n\nThis camera script is a modification of the original driver.lua script that comes with the game. I have added screen shaking effects and additional g-force driven effects to increase the sense of speed and improve the fun-factor of driving overall. These camera effects are partially inspired by Forza and DriveClub.\n\nSpeed screen shake\n[MEDIA=youtube]oI0YYdl4X6I[\/MEDIA]\n\nJump g-force effect\n[MEDIA=youtube]AMqWX17AGbk[\/MEDIA]\n\nHead-on collision effect\n[MEDIA=youtube]2tizvcWoN84[\/MEDIA]\n\nDrift screen shake\n[MEDIA=youtube]a8reZI7TQWI[\/MEDIA]\n\n[B]Features:[\/B]\n[LIST]\n[*]Subtle screen shake when over 100 mph.\n[*]Screen shake while drifting.\n[*]Camera tilts back slightly when accelerating.\n[*]Camera tilts forward slightly while braking.\n[*]Camera jerks forward on heavy head-on collisions.\n[*]Camera jerks forward with heavy upward g-forces.
